# node-red-contrib-rotate-logger

This project is forked from [`Advance Logger`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-red-contrib-advance-logger)

And using `winston.DailyRotateFile` I changed the original file logging feature to rotate file logging with date pattern

This project is for personal purpose so I recommend not to use this module in your production environment

Please check the original project for details
